Competitive Auctions on eBay.com. The file eBayAuctions.csv contains information
on 1972 auctions that transacted on eBay.com during Mayâ€“June 2004. The goal
is to use these data to build a model that will classify auctions as competitive or noncompetitive.
A competitive auction is defined as an auction with at least two bids placed
on the item auctioned. The data include variables that describe the item (auction category),
the seller (his/her eBay rating), and the auction terms that the seller selected
(auction duration, opening price, currency, day-of-week of auction close). In addition,
we have the price at which the auction closed. The task is to predict whether or
not the auction will be competitive.
